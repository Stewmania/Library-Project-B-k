 Zero: A protective hero romantic suspense ,"Zero’s an arrogant, enigmatic, dangerous hacker.
He wants to protect me.
Pity.
He’s too late. I’m a lost cause.
I narrowly escaped death only to now live on a knife’s edge, constantly checking the shadows for monsters.
And I can’t trust him.
He knows far too much about me, and I know nothing about him.
Even still, this inscrutable stranger burrows his way under my skin and into my heart.
With only a look, Zero makes me feel more alive than ever before.
And that’s the problem.
I should be dead.
I’m the aftermath of a tragedy.
Broken.
A victim.
But he calls me a survivor.
He’s wrong.
There’s no way I’ll cheat death twice, not when it’s breathing down my neck.
