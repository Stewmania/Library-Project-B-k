 Zero: A protective hero romantic suspense ,"Zero’s an arrogant, enigmatic, dangerous hacker.
He wants to protect me.
Pity.
He’s too late. I’m a lost cause.

And I can’t trust him.
He knows far too much about me, and I know nothing about him.
Even still, this inscrutable stranger burrows his way under my skin and into my heart.
With only a look, Zero makes me feel more alive than ever before.
And that’s the problem.
I should be dead.
I’m the aftermath of a tragedy.
Broken.
A victim.
But he calls me a survivor.
He’s wrong.
There’s no way I’ll cheat death twice, not when it’s breathing down my neck.

Zero
is really something""-Washington Post
A New York Times Notable Book.
The Babylonians invented it, the Greeks banned it, the Hindus worshiped it, and the Church used it to fend off heretics. Now it threatens the foundations of modern physics. For centuries the power of zero savored of the demonic; once harnessed, it became the most important tool in mathematics. For zero, infinity's twin, is not like other numbers. It is both nothing and everything.
In
Zero
, Science Journalist Charles Seife follows this innocent-looking number from its birth as an Eastern philosophical concept to its struggle for acceptance in Europe, its rise and transcendence in the West, and its ever-present threat to modern physics. Here are the legendary thinkers—from Pythagoras to Newton to Heisenberg, from the Kabalists to today's astrophysicists—who have tried to understand it and whose clashes shook the foundations of philosophy, science, mathematics, and religion. Zero has pitted East against West and faith against reason, and its intransigence persists in the dark core of a black hole and the brilliant flash of the Big Bang. Today, zero lies at the heart of one of the biggest scientific controversies of all time: the quest for a theory of everything.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41m7uIj+h9L._SY346_.jpg,0,4,Charles Seife
